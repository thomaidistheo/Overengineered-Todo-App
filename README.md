# Another Todo App?
**My goal here is to have a well-designed todo app with a well written code base while trying to follow best practices**<br>
_DONE is a todo app created to mainly practice `React` and `Typescript` but also integrations such as a `Weather API` and `Firebase Firestore`._


`🛠️ Current version: v1.0 🎉`
